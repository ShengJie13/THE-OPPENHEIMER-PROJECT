# THE-OPPENHEIMER-PROJECT

 BACKGROUND
 
 In the year 1969, the City of Carson is a growing city that housed close to millions of working class heroes^. To support the growing city population, a
 bill was passed that:
     ‘each working class hero is to contribute a fraction of their yearly income towards city building’
 This year, as part of the governor’s initiative to pony up surplus cash in the vault, each working class hero is gifted with taxation relief as recognition for their voluntary contribution to city building efforts.
 To facilitate this, the governor has drafted out the Oppenheimer Project. This is a software system that has to support 3 features:
         - Enable Clerks to populate a list of working class heroes to the system
         - Enable Bookkeepers to retrieve the payable taxation relief for each working class
